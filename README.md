Open-Zwave wrapper for Rust
===========================

[Documentation](http://fxbox.github.io/openzwave-rust/openzwave/)

See also the more featureful library [openzwave-stateful](https://github.com/fxbox/openzwave-stateful-rust).

Installation
------------

Simply using the crate should work.

We build openzwave from [a fork](https://github.com/fxbox/open-zwave) of the
[original repository](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave). The change is a
simple change to the Makefile that we still intend to upstream.

So we don't use any copy of openzwave you may have on your machine.
